This is old, not robust and should be rewrote. But it kinda works.

wanpppc.pl is UPnP WANConnectionDevice device controller which implements 
WANPPPConnection service. 

For further details see:
http://upnp.org/specs/gw/UPnP-gw-WANPPPConnection-v1-Service.pdf
http://upnp.org/specs/arch/UPnP-arch-DeviceArchitecture-v1.1.pdf

It's written in pure core perl (actualy IO::Scalar is not core as I found out)
and no additional modules are needed. It uses builting XML::Tiny to parse xml
so it will run even in very old perl environments. It's meant to be distributed
as single script with no dependencies except perl core so please keep that in
mind if you are introducing any changes.

USAGE
_____

You can get list of supported actions and usage information by executing 
wanppc.pl without arguments. 

HOST argument has to have format of <hostname>:<port> where hostname can also
be IPv4 address in dot-decimal notation. Note that port is not optional.

User interface and output is not really user-friendly and requires some
knowledge of UPnP stack (see links above).

Example:

$ perl wanpppc.pl 192.168.1.1:80 /upnp/control?WANPPPConnection GetExternalIPAddress 
GetExternalIPAddressResponse: 
    NewExternalIPAddress: 84.47.61.244
$

TIPS
____

* SOAP response parsing is not really robust and can misbehave. It uses built-in
  XML::Tiny module so if you are experiencing errors on valid responses set
  $DEBUG in wanpppc.pl to true value to output raw response.

TODO (in order of importance):
_____________________________

* Use more CPAN and App::FatPacker?
* Support automatic multicast/unicast and bruteforce discovery of control url
* Support all standard actions of WANPPConnection service
* Support other XML parsing modules if found installed
* Support UPnP eventing?
* Make interface more user-friendly 
* Support IPv6 

TESTED WITH
___________

* Some old Pirelli router (couldn't find model number)
* Thomson TG585 v7
